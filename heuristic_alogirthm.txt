1. Start with a straight line between points. Check if it satisfies heading / minimum straight length requirements.
2. Add circles tangent to the start and end points in the right direction.
    a. Move along line until minimum start/end length is met.
    b. Check minimum straight length of new tangent.
        i.  if circles are same direction merge them together
        ii. if they pass each other that path will fail
